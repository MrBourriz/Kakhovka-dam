# About

The provided Colab analyzes and visualizes satellite images of the Kakhovka dam, capturing the condition before and after its destruction. The script uses the Google Earth Engine API and the geemap library to load, filter, and display Sentinel-2 satellite images for the specified date ranges, providing a visual comparison of the dam area before and after the presumed event of destruction.
